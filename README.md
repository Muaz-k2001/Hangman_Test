# Hangman_Test

A repository containing the finished work of creating a hangman game using python.

### Milestone 1:
Added detail to the ask_letter() method.

### Milestone 2:
Initialised the relevant attributes using the init method and added further detail to the ask_letter() method.

### Milestone 3:
Completed and called the check_letter() method using the letter from the ask_letter() method.

### Milestone 4:
Completed the project by adding win and lose conditions in the ask_letter() method which completes the game.

(BONUS) Added the hangman drawings for each stage of life loss.

### Conclusion
The hangman game works well with both win and lose conditions ending the game. I understood and can comfortably explain what each line does.
